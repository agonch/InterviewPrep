Given root of binary tree, return a list holding children pointing at their parents,
and those nodes at their parents, ..., all the way up to root.
The pointers get flipped from top down (root to children) to bottom up (from children to root).

So you flip the direction of the pointers, starting at the children nodes. This is why you need list to keep track of children.
