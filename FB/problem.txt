Implement an iterator over a binary tree (not necessarily a BST). Your iterator 
will be initialized with the root node of the tree. Calling next() will 
return the next value, in ""in-order traversal"". Note: next() and hasNext() 
should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the 
height of the tree.
