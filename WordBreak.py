"""
Problem:
  Can a string with no punctuation or spacing be split into a list 
  of valid words? Use dynamic programming, do it in O(n^2). Example:
        wordBreak('ilikesamsung') = true
        wordBreak('lilikesmng') = false
  because "i", "like", "samsung" are words.
    Input: S    = input string
           dict = dictionary of valid words
    Define T to be the table you memoize the subproblems in.

-- 2 approaches:

1) Working backwards, where T[i] indicates whether 
   S[iâ€¦n-1] can be split into a sequence of words.

2) T[i] indicates S[0...i-1] can be split into a sequence of words.
